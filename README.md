To run it:

From a PC:
1. Verify your WiFi connection
2. Open the server
3. Press "Start"

From an Android phone:
1. Install the application
2. Connect to the same WiFi as the PC (only tested it in the same wifi)
3. Make sure your GPS is on
4. Select the network protocol you would like your location to be sent
